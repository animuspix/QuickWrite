# Things to do

* Refactor, some of the code is a bit janky and could definitely be cleaned up
* Expand the range of formatting possible - if we can duplicate HTML with half as much code, we're done
* Assign $file to the first text file found in the root, rather than asking the user to define it during setup
* Make the system more accessible, so that e.g. someone could type into a text field and the input would be processed as QuickWrite

Anything else? Feel free to add it, the above are just core things that I want to implement. The closer it brings QuickWrite to being a
markup language or a blogging platform, the better :)
